Welcome to the Universal Pokemon Randomizer FVX wiki!

This wiki documents some details regarding the randomizer's logic, as well as explains how to use certain features of the randomizer that are not immediately intuitive (such as randomization of 3DS games).

Note that information about the randomizer's various options is available by hovering over the options in the randomizer program - the pages on this wiki contain extra information that take up too much space to be in the program itself.

This wiki was largely ported from [the ZX branch's wiki](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki).
