# Type Chart Fix Applied - Summary

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Problem Fixed
Your randomizer was crashing when trying to reopen ROMs that had been edited with type chart editors (like TEE Master) because it couldn't handle custom type bytes outside the original 18 Gen 3 types.

**Error Message:**
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Type null not supported by this TypeTable.
    at com.dabomstew.pkromio.romhandlers.Gen3RomHandler.readTypeTable(Gen3RomHandler.java:4090)
```

## Solution Applied

**File Modified:** `src/com/dabomstew/pkromio/romhandlers/Gen3RomHandler.java`

**Method:** `readTypeTable()` (lines 4061-4098)

### What Changed:

**BEFORE:**
```java
Type attacking = Gen3Constants.typeTable[attackingType];
Type defending = Gen3Constants.typeTable[defendingType];
```
❌ This would crash if `attackingType` or `defendingType` were outside the array bounds (e.g., custom type at 0x12)

**AFTER:**
```java
// Bounds check to handle ROMs edited with custom types by other editors
Type attacking = (attackingType >= 0 && attackingType < Gen3Constants.typeTable.length) 
    ? Gen3Constants.typeTable[attackingType] : null;
Type defending = (defendingType >= 0 && defendingType < Gen3Constants.typeTable.length) 
    ? Gen3Constants.typeTable[defendingType] : null;

// Only process entries with recognized types
if (attacking != null && defending != null) {
    // ... process effectiveness ...
}
```
✅ Now performs bounds checking and only processes known types

## How It Works

1. **Reads type bytes** from the ROM (e.g., 0x00 = Normal, 0x12 = custom type)
2. **Checks if valid** - is the type byte within the known Gen 3 type range?
3. **If valid** - processes the type effectiveness entry normally
4. **If invalid** - silently skips the entry (no crash!)
5. **Result** - ROM loads successfully, vanilla types work perfectly

## What This Means For You

✅ **Can now reopen edited ROMs** - No more crashes when loading ROMs edited with TEE Master or other type chart editors

✅ **Maintains compatibility** - Unmodified ROMs work exactly as before

✅ **Type chart editor still works** - You can still edit vanilla type matchups (Normal, Fire, Water, etc.)

⚠️ **Custom types are ignored** - If someone added a "Fairy" or "Sound" type using another editor, those specific matchups won't be preserved when you save. BUT the ROM will load and work.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with unmodified ROM** - Should work exactly as before
2. **Test with TEE-edited ROM** - Should now load without errors
3. **Edit type chart** - Vanilla type matchups should save/load correctly
4. **Save and reopen** - Your own edits should persist properly

## Technical Details

The fix follows TEE Master's approach of being **defensive when reading** - it doesn't assume the ROM data is in a specific format. Instead of:
- ❌ Assuming all type bytes are 0x00-0x11
- ✅ Checking each byte and handling unknowns gracefully

This is the same principle TEE Master uses (lines 290-383 in Form1.cs), but adapted to your existing architecture.

### Additional Update (Pointer Sync)

After further testing we found that the ROM still opened with a blank (all neutral) chart if the type table was repointed to new free space. TEE works because it reads the pointer stored in the ROM each time, while our handler always used the original hardcoded offset from `gen3_offsets.ini`.

**Fix:** `Gen3RomHandler` now looks up the correct pointer per ROM code (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen) and refreshes `TypeEffectivenessOffset` from the live pointer in the ROM during load. That keeps our reader in sync with repointed tables, so reopening an edited ROM now shows the exact values we wrote—just like TEE.

**Files touched:** still only `src/com/dabomstew/pkromio/romhandlers/Gen3RomHandler.java`, but now with an additional helper map and a call to `readPointer()` during initialization.
