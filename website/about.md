## About the Universal Pokémon Randomizer

The **Universal Pokémon Randomizer** (**UPR**) is a randomizer for Pokémon games, originally released by Dabomstew in 2012. Like other randomizers, it can shuffle around and change the data of the target game to your liking. The Randomizer also contains various quality-of-life features, like turning off trade evolutions or choosing exactly which Pokémon to have as your starter.

All versions of the UPR can randomize:

- Pokémon base stats
- Pokémon types
- Pokémon abilities
- Pokémon evolutions
- Pokémon movesets
- 

- Starter Pokémon
- "Static" Pokémon, like legendary encounters, gifts, and ones you buy

- Trainer teams
- Trainer names and trainer class names

## About the FVX branch

The **Universal Pokémon Randomizer FVX** (**F**ox + **V**oliol + z**X**) is a continuation of the Universal Pokémon Randomizer. It was born of a merge of branches by [foxoftheasterisk](https://github.com/foxoftheasterisk/UPR-ZX-closer-to-vanilla) and [voliol](https://github.com/voliol/universal-pokemon-randomizer), both based on [Ajarmar's UPR ZX](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx).

[... say something about ZX, what it added relative the original FVX]

Compared to ZX, FVX adds a number of features; from upgrades to Trainer and wild Pokémon randomization, to Pokémon Palette randomization and Custom Player Graphics. For a full list of new features, see [this wiki page](../wiki/New-Feature-Summary).

True to its ancestry in ZX, it supports all vanilla core series Pokémon games from Generation 1-7 except Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!; in other words, it supports all core series games for the GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS.

For developers, FVX also has a considerable amount of refactoring and new features, including separate Randomizer classes for each category of randomization, a SpeciesSet class with many helper functions, and automated tests for most features.

## History of the Randomizer
December 12 2012, Dabomstew released the first version of the Universal Pokemon Randomizer. It was not the first randomizer of its kind, Artemis251's Emerald randomizer among others (see [Acknowledgements](./Acknowledgements) had already broken the ground of randomizing Pokémon games. What made the UPR stand out was its goal of being able to randomize all then-released Pokémon games, from Gen 1 to Gen 5. Thus, the *Universal* Pokémon Randomizer.

May 15 2014, in conjunction with the release of UPR 1.6.1, the Randomizer became open source, [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Dabomstew/universal-pokemon-randomizer). 

October 21, 2016, Dabomstew stopped working on the project, passing the torch to the community to continue its development and maintenance. 

[date] The Universal Pokémon Randomizer ZX is a significant branch that emerged from the original UPR. Developed by Ajarmar with significant contributions from darkeye and cleartonic, [...].

Despite its popularity, the development of the ZX branch eventually ceased. The last update was released in early 2023 [? give specific date], marking the end of an era for this particular branch.

## Other Pokémon randomizers and UPR branches

As mentioned above, the UPR is not the only tool for randomizing Pokémon games, and the FVX branch is not its only branch. 

Below, a small selection of other randomizers and branches are listed. They have been chosen for being notable and filling niches that the UPR or the FVX branch don't. However, there are more! See [The BIG List of Video Game Randomizers](https://randomizers.debigare.com/) for more non-UPR randomizers, and browse through forks on GitHub to find unmentioned branches. 

### Randomizers

- **[The Crystal Randofuser](https://github.com/xCrystal/crystal-randofuser)** (by xCrystal) [...].
- **[Sanqui's Online Randomizer]** (by Sanqui) is not only an online randomizer for Pokémon Red, [...].
- **[GBAXG](https://kittypboxx.github.io/GBAXG/)** (by KittyPBoxx) [...].
- **[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)** is a so-called "multi-game" randomizer. Not only does it support many many games from disparate franchises, but it lets you combine them in a sense. Or if you don't feel up for that, the games can be randomized by their own. At the time of writing, Archipelago officially supports Pokémon [Red/Blue](https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Red%20and%20Blue/info/en) and (Emerald)[https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Emerald/info/en], but more are likely to be added in the future. 

### Branches

- **[The Gaia Fork](https://github.com/sphericalice/universal-pokemon-randomizer)** (by Spherical Ice) branches off from the original UPR, and adds support to the popular Gaia ROM hack.
- **[brentspector's branch]()** (by brentspector) branches off from the original UPR, [...].
