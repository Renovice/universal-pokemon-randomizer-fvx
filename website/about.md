## Other Pokémon randomizers and UPR branches

As mentioned above, the UPR is not the only tool for randomizing Pokémon games, and the FVX branch is not its only branch. 

Below, a small selection of other randomizers and branches are listed. They have been chosen for being notable and filling niches that the UPR or the FVX branch don't. However, there are more! See [The BIG List of Video Game Randomizers](https://randomizers.debigare.com/) for more non-UPR randomizers, and browse through forks on GitHub to find unmentioned branches. 

### Randomizers

- **[The Crystal Randofuser](https://github.com/xCrystal/crystal-randofuser)** (by xCrystal) [...].
- **[Sanqui's Online Randomizer]** (by Sanqui) is not only an online randomizer for Pokémon Red, [...].
- **[GBAXG](https://kittypboxx.github.io/GBAXG/)** (by KittyPBoxx) [...].
- **[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)** is a so-called "multi-game" randomizer. Not only does it support many many games from disparate franchises, but it lets you combine them in a sense. Or if you don't feel up for that, the games can be randomized by their own. At the time of writing, Archipelago officially supports Pokémon [Red/Blue](https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Red%20and%20Blue/info/en) and (Emerald)[https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Emerald/info/en], but more are likely to be added in the future. 

### Branches

- **[The Gaia Fork](https://github.com/sphericalice/universal-pokemon-randomizer)** (by Spherical Ice) branches off from the original UPR, and adds support to the popular Gaia ROM hack.
- **[brentspector's branch]()** (by brentspector) branches off from the original UPR, [...]. 
- **[Ironhidelvan's branch](https://github.com/IronhideIvan/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx)** (by Ironhidelvan) branches off from ZX, [...].
