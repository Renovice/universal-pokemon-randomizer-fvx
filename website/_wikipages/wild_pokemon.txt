## Minimum Catch Rate Odds

This section describes the minimum odds for catching any given Pokemon when the "Set Minimum Catch Rate" setting is enabled. This setting has a slider that lets you select various "levels"; as the level increases, the minimum odds of catching any given Pokemon also increases.

### Notes
- These odds assume that you are using a standard Poke Ball on a wild Pokemon that is not afflicted with any status ailment. If you are using a different ball, or you have inflicted a status ailment, then these odds should be multiplied by the appropriate amount.
- These odds are the *minimum* odds for catching any given Pokemon. Depending on which level you select, certain Pokemon may have higher odds than what is listed in these tables. For level 4, however, all Pokemon will have the same odds.
- For the Generation 1 and Generation 2 games, the maximum HP of the wild Pokemon influences the odds of catching it. For the values listed in the table below, a base HP stat of 45 was used to compute these odds.
- In the Generation 5 games, your odds of catching a wild Pokemon are reduced if that Pokemon was encountered in dark grass. The severity of this reduction depends on how many species are registered as "caught" in your Pokedex. The values listed in the table below assume that the Pokemon is being encountered in "normal" terrain; if you're trying to catch a wild Pokemon in dark grass, multiply these odds by the following amounts:
  - 0-30 species caught: 1229/4096 (roughly 0.3)
  - 31-150 species caught: 2048/4096 (exactly 0.5)
  - 151-300 species caught: 2867/4096 (roughly 0.7)
  - 301-450 species caught: 3277/4096 (roughly 0.8)
  - 451-600 species caught: 3686/4096 (roughly 0.9)
  - 601+ species caught: 4096/4096 (exactly 1; in other words, there is no longer any reduction in odds)

### Level 5
This level bypasses odds entirely and *guarantees* that any wild Pokemon will be captured with any ball. The only exceptions to this guarantee are Pokemon that are not normally catchable in the original game (e.g, Ghosts before acquiring the Silph Scope in Gen 1, Black/White Kyurem in Black 2/White 2, etc.). These Pokemon will remain uncatchable.
