Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX - V branch

A fork of the Universal Pokemon Randomizer focused on adding new features, especially those that make the randomized ROMs into a more "Vanilla-like" experience. For now, this has largely been Type-focused randomizations.
in turn based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer by Dabomstew
and a bunch of refactoring for ease-of-development. 

For a full list of new features, see the wiki.
[The main branch Wiki Page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/Building-Universal-Pokemon-Randomizer-ZX) explains how to set up to build/test locally, with the caveat that the V branch runs off Java 18.

### What is a good fit for the randomizer?

In general, the UPR should have settings as universal as possible (up to Gen V). This means that an idea preferably should work in as many games as possible, and also that it's something that many people will find useful/fun. If the setting is very niche, it will mostly just bloat the GUI.

If your idea is a change to an existing setting rather than a new setting, it needs to be well motivated.

# Feature requests

I gladly take feature requests to know what the user-base wants, but be aware that I am a single person working on this, and will implement them (or not) at my own discretion and pace. 
Features related to other ones in the V branch (like palette randomization) are more likely to get picked up, but the above still applies. If you want to guarantee your feature makes it in, the only way is to pick up Java and code it yourself. It's fun :)

# Other problems

If you have problems using the randomizer, it could be because of some problem with Java or your operating system. **If you have problems with starting the randomizer specifically, [read this page first before creating an issue.](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/About-Java)** If that page does not solve your problem, submit an issue using the `Need Help` issue template.
